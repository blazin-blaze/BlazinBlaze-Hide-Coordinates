# Blazin Hide Coordinates

**Allows you to hide the X/Z coordinates inside the Minecraft F3 Menu**

Useful if you are streaming or sharing your screen and don't want others to know where you are located in the world, but still want to be able to see your Y coordinate!
_(You may also toggle the Y coordinate off in the YAML config file if you'd like)_

Coordinates are toggled on/off by using the F6 key by default, but can be binded any other key in the Controls menu

May or may not be compatible with other F3 menu mods. Future updates may add support to these mods if there is a high enough demand. :)
