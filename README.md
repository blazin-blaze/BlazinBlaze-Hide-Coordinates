# Blazin Hide Coordinates

**Allows you to hide the X/Z coordinates inside the Minecraft F6 Menu**

Useful if you are streaming or sharing your screen and don't want others to know where you are located in the world, but still want to be able to see your Y coordinate!
_(You may also toggle the Y coordinate off in the YAML config file if you'd like)_

Coordinates are toggled on/off by using the F6 key by default, but can be binded any other key in the Controls menu
